# Configuring SAST tools user study

This page contains the artifact related to the paper "Can the configuration of static analysis tools make resolving security vulnerabilites more effective?" by Goran Piskachev, Matthias Becker, and Eric Bodden. 

## Questionnaire and data

During the study, we used Google Form to collect the answers from all 40 participants. The moderator walked through the form together with the participant. 
The questionnaire can be found [here](https://github.com/research-sast-config/research-sast-config.github.io/blob/main/Questionnaire.pdf). 

The raw data is [here](https://github.com/research-sast-config/research-sast-config.github.io/blob/main/Config%20SAST%20User%20Study%20-%20Data%20Raw.csv). 
The filled form of each participant can be found [here](https://github.com/research-sast-config/research-sast-config.github.io/blob/main/FormWithAnswers.pdf).


Moreover, we processed some of the data in two additional documents. Download them here: [RQ2](https://github.com/research-sast-config/research-sast-config.github.io/blob/main/RQ2.xlsx?raw=true) and [RQ3](https://github.com/research-sast-config/research-sast-config.github.io/blob/main/RQ3.xlsx?raw=true)
